              " <p>KUALA LUMPUR/SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Embattled Chinese developer Country Garden said on Monday its $100-billion project in Malaysia was proceeding as planned and it had sufficient assets, despite concerns about its financial strength amid debt woes.</p>,\n",
              " <p>The comment by China's largest private developer came after it missed two dollar coupon payments this month totaling $22.5 million, fuelling fears that the country's property debt crisis could hamper a broader economic recovery and spill overseas.</p>,\n",
              " <p>\"Our company's projects in Malaysia are operating normally and the sales performance is strong,\" the developer's Singapore and Malaysia unit said in a statement, adding that its overall operation in the region was \"safe and stable.\"</p>,\n",
              " <p>\"Various debt management measures are considered to actively resolve the pressure of periodic liquidity, to ensure the company's long-term future development,\" it added, without elaborating.</p>,\n",
              " <p>Banks incorporated in the Southeast Asian nation had limited exposure to Country Garden, Malaysia's central bank said, adding that its Malaysia unit was servicing loans promptly.</p>,\n",
              " <p>\"The current development with Country Garden Holdings Ltd in China is not expected to pose any material impact on the overall property market activity and prices in Malaysia,\" Bank Negara Malaysia told Reuters in an email.</p>,\n",
              " <p>The Chinese developer is building its largest overseas development, the massive Forest City project, across four reclaimed islands in the southern Malaysian state of Johor bordering the wealthy city state of Singapore.</p>,\n",
              " <p>Beset by challenges since its 2016 launch, the project, now home to about 9,000 people, saw demand fall sharply following China's move to stem capital outflows and the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>,\n",
              " <p>Malaysians have also expressed concern at the prospect of a housing glut and environmental damage from a huge land reclamation effort.</p>,\n",
              " <p>The project aims to house 700,000 people by 2035 in a development that includes office towers, malls and schools, besides residential buildings.</p>,\n",
              " <p>The company statement comes after Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said the project would be designated a \"special financial zone\" to attract investment, and help cut the cost of doing business there.</p>,\n",
              " <p>Among the new incentives offered are a special income tax rate of 15% for skilled workers and multiple entry visas, Anwar said in a statement on Friday.</p>,\n",
              " <p>RHB analyst Loong Kok Wen said the new designation would attract companies and residents from Singapore, where costs are considerably higher.</p>,\n",
              " <p>\"This move should help to revitalise the Forest City township, which has received lots of negative publicity over the last few years,\" the analyst said.</p>,\n",
              " <p>Malaysia's incentives should be \"very positive\" for Country Garden, said Steven Leung, Hong Kong-based director of UOB Kay Hian.</p>,\n",
              " <p>The Chinese developer said the incentives from Anwar's government showed its confidence in the project, which was now in a second phase of development focused on exploring more investment opportunities.</p>,\n",
              " <p>Shares of Country Garden closed flat after having risen as much as 9% on Monday.</p>,\n",
              " <p>Forest City is a joint venture with Esplanade Danga 88, a private Malaysian company backed by the Johor government and the sultan of the state.</p>,\n",

              "{'BTC': ['A lawyer working for Grayscale Investments asked to meet with the Securities and Exchange Commission \"as soon as practical\" in a Tuesday letter that prodded the regulator to approve the conversion of Grayscale’s bitcoin trust into a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund. The attorney from David Polk & Wardwell LLP asked for the meeting to \"discuss the way forward\" following a critical decision last month from a three-judge panel of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals that injected a new wave of optimism into crypto markets. The judges concluded that the SEC was \"arbitrary and capricious\" when it denied Grayscale’s conversion application in 2022 after previously approving ETF products that held bitcoin futures contracts. A spot bitcoin ETF would allow investors to get exposure to the world’s largest cryptocurrency without having to own it, possibly expanding mainstream acceptance of digital assets. In the hours following the court decision, bitcoin rose 8% and briefly touched $28,000. But within 48 hours bitcoin (BTC-USD) gave back those gains and the rally soon fizzled. In the last 24 hours bitcoin has fallen slightly, trading below $26,000 by Tuesday afternoon. It is down 1% over the past week. There is no guarantee the SEC will act in a way favorable to Grayscale following the court ruling, which only requires the SEC to review Grayscale\\'s application, not to approve it. The SEC has until mid-October to request a re-hearing of the case. It has said it is reviewing the decision. \"We must not get too excited, too carried away,\" Ric Edelman, founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday. \"The court did not order the SEC to approve these ETFs. The court merely said that its rejection of Grayscale\\'s application was inappropriate.\" Last week Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein said in an interview with Yahoo Finance that \"we have to be a little bit patient.\" Tuesday’s letter from his firm’s attorney applied more urgency, arguing that any further delay would harm investors. \"We believe the trust’s nearly one million investors deserve this fair playing field as quickly as possible,\" wrote Joseph',\n",

              "  'A new wave of volatility is rippling through the crypto world, ending a period of recent summer slumber for investors in digital currencies. The price of bitcoin (BTC-USD) tumbled as much as 9% Thursday and briefly dropped below $26,000, the biggest one-day change in the world’s largest digital currency this year. It is down 8% over the last 24 hours as of 11:30 a.m. ET time Friday. Investors sold $489 million in bitcoin futures over a 24-hour period, the largest single-day liquidation since June 2022, according to data provider Coinalyze. Market watchers grasped at several theories for the sudden downward movement. Some pointed to news from The Wall Street Journal that Elon Musk\\'s SpaceX had reportedly written down the value of its crypto holdings in 2021 and 2022 and sold those holdings. Others pointed to fears of a worsening macroeconomic outlook that might dampen appetite for riskier assets, citing the bankruptcy filing of Chinese property developer Evergrande as well as the possibility that the Federal Reserve could hold interest rates higher for longer. \"The next week or two is going to be extremely important for this asset class,\" Matt Maley, chief market strategist with Miller Tabak + Co., said in a Friday note, pointing to both the \"higher-for-longer\" outlook at the Fed and \"forced selling\" in the crypto derivatives market as contributors to bitcoin’s sharp drop. Bitcoin’s high point came in 2021 when it surged to $68,789 during an industry boom triggered by a period of low interest rates and fiscal stimulus that put excess savings in the pockets of investors. The market crashed in 2022 as the giant crypto exchange FTX collapsed, before making a surprise comeback during the early half of 2023. Investors will be watching to see whether bitcoin can remain above its next key support level of $25,000. Such a move below that point would prove “bearish” for the crypto market and possibly \"something that could be signaling some more declines in other risk assets in the days and weeks ahead,\" Maley said. The industry still faces legal and regulatory scrutiny that could also influence prices.',\n",

              "  'Large bitcoin (BTC) investors – “whales” in crypto terms – seemed undeterred by the recent weakness in price and substantially increased their holdings. Data by crypto analytics firm IntoTheBlock shows that addresses holding at least 0.1% of the bitcoin supply – worth more than $500 million – increased their stash by a total of $1.5 billion in the last two weeks of August. The increase occurred while inflows into centralized exchanges were near zero, suggesting that “there is organic buying demand rather than just funds moving to exchange addresses,” Lucas Outumuro, head of research at IntoTheBlock, wrote in a report. Whales are entities who control large amounts of a digital asset. Their purchases and sales can have a sizable impact on markets, thus crypto watchers closely follow their behavior to anticipate market movements. The purchases happened during a period when BTC’s price sunk to a two-month low, temporarily lifted by an important court decision in Grayscale’s campaign to list a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund in the U.S. Large holders first loaded up after Aug. 17, when BTC plunged more than 10% to below $26,000, its lowest price since June, IntoTheBlock data shows. They also increased holdings earlier this week following asset manager Grayscale’s court victory over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A federal appeals court ordered the agency to vacate and review its denial to convert the $14 billion Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into a more-desirable spot bitcoin ETF. Analysts interpreted the court’s decision as a key advance towards listing the first spot BTC ETF in the U.S., making the largest cryptocurrency more accessible for a new class of investors. Still, BTC has erased all gains from the brief rally ignited by the Grayscale ruling and slid back below $26,000 on Friday. Despite the weak price action, the accumulation suggests that “institutional investors are getting optimistic in bitcoin as ETF decisions approach,” Outumuro said. Related Quotes',\n",
              "  'The biggest financial houses in the U.S. are peddling Bitcoin\\'s message and don’t even know it. You see, modern-day marketing isn\\'t confined to catchy ads or snappy slogans. It\\'s about how a concept is presented, the narrative that\\'s woven and the influence it exerts on decision-making. Today, bitcoin (BTC) is more than just “magic internet money” or lines of code — it\\'s actually reshaping the way we think about finance across the board. Tim Haldorsson is the CEO of crypto growth agency Lunar Strategy. At first, it might not seem like it but the recent buzz about bitcoin spot market exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications by heavyweight financial players like BlackRock, Fidelity Investments and VanEck is more than just noise — it\\'s a strategic marketing move that\\'s subtly rewriting the Bitcoin narrative. Isn’t it remarkable how Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, did a complete U-turn on his stance on Bitcoin from years ago? In a recent interview, he pretty much said Bitcoin is on a path to fueling a revolution in finance. See also: The Real Reasons the Grayscale Bitcoin ETF Decision Matters | Opinion Let’s dive into why this ETF hoopla is a net positive for Bitcoin, regardless of whether these applications get the green light or face the red tape. When you and I hear the term \"bitcoin ETF,\" it might not trigger lightbulbs in our heads. But in a room full of financial bigwigs, that phrase carries a lot of weight. Why? Because associating it with exchange-traded funds is a gentle assertion that Bitcoin is knocking on the doors of conventional finance. With each ETF application, the leadership of major financial giants are signing up to do “word-of-mouth” marketing for Bitcoin. This canvassing goes beyond press releases, conferences and interviews, extending beyond the public eye to private – and much more influential – circles. This particular news cycle is significant because it injects Bitcoin with a dose of credibility, bolstering its legitimacy as an asset class in the eyes of seasoned financiers.

              "  'BTC-margined contracts now account for 33% of the total futures open interest, up from 20% in July, according to Glassnode. The contracts offer a non-linear payoff, bringing traders to their position-liquidation point faster than cash-margined contracts. Bitcoin (BTC) is unlikely to shed its tag as an unpredictable and volatile asset any time soon because crypto traders are increasingly using the largest cryptocurrency as a margin in futures trading. Since July, the percentage of bitcoin futures open interest margined with bitcoin has risen to 33% from roughly 20%, according to data tracked by Glassnode. Cash or stablecoin-margined contracts still account for 65% of the total open interest. Futures are leveraged products, allowing traders to maximize exposure for a deposit at the exchange, known as margin, which is a small percent of the contract size. The exchange provides the rest of the value of the trade. The renewed interest in BTC-margined contracts means potential for volatility-boosting liquidations cascades, according to research provider Blockware Intelligence. That occurs when multiple liquidations – or forced closure of positions due to margin shortage – happen consecutively, causing a rapid price change. \"Using BTC as collateral for a BTC derivative is effectively a double whammy,\" analysts at Blockware Intelligence said in a weekly newsletter. \"If you\\'re long BTC with BTC posted as collateral, the price going down brings you to your liquidation point faster because the value of your collateral is declining at the same time. \"Leveraging against your BTC during its monetization phase is extremely risky, [as] you can be correct directionally, but volatility can wipe you out regardless.\" Coin-margined contracts are quoted in U.S. dollars, but margined and settled in cryptocurrencies. In other words, the collateral is as volatile as the position, creating a non-linear payoff, where a trader earns less when the market rallies and loses more when the market drops. So, not only does a long position bleed as bitcoin\\'s dollar-denominated price drops, but the collateral also loses value, compounding losses. That, in turn, results in a relatively quick margin shortfall and potential liquidation. The trend is worrying in a sense that should',\n",

              " 'Tesla': [\"When Tesla slashes prices, as it did this week, shoppers looking for electric vehicles generally benefit. But for anyone who buys a Tesla right before such price cuts, the frustration can be acute. Waiting just a little longer to buy, after all, could have saved them a significant amount of money—but they had no way of knowing. A risk for Elon Musk’s carmaker, which has repeatedly cut prices on its high-end models this year, is that existing customers will feel resentment—not to mention see their vehicle lose value—while some shoppers hesitate to buy because another price cut might be right around the corner. After the carmaker made its latest price cuts on Thursday, new Tesla owners vented their frustration on social media, often addressing Musk in posts on X (formerly Twitter), the social network he owns. One tweet posted on Friday reads: “Tesla screws with people so much when they drop price by $20k+. I just picked up my Model S Plaid one day ago, drove less than 100 miles on it and I'm shafted by over $20k. TESLA NEVER AGAIN.” That followed Tesla dramatically dropping the price—by about $18,500—of the Plaid versions of its Model X SUV and Model S sedan. The carmaker also made significant price cuts across the rest of its X and S range. Shoppers can now get a Model S for a base price of $74,990 and a Model X for $79,990—that’s $3,500 and $8,500 less, respectively, than earlier in the week. What’s more, the carmaker decided to no longer charge extra for certain paint colors. So a customer who on Monday bought a Plaid version of either model with a paint color costing extra was in all likelihood fuming by Friday—or will be soon when they learn of the reductions. “These big unexpected price cuts definitely not fair with one’s who recently bought Tesla vehicles,” reads one tweet posted Friday. A reply to that on Friday reads: “I just bought the S (today) but I agree, pretty crappy, they are going to lose some loyalty.” Also frustrated are those who bought either model at\",\n",
              "  'Mercedes-Benz has just unveiled new “close-to-production” concept vehicles that could outdo Tesla cars by going more than 466 miles on a single charge. That’s compared with a range of less than 380 miles for any Tesla model. The German automaker’s Concept CLA Class, revealed Sunday at the IAA Mobility auto show in Munich, comprises four new models: a sedan, a station wagon and two SUVs. The company did not specify when exactly they would enter production. The vehicles will each have a range of more than 750 kilometers (466 miles), versus Tesla’s (TSLA) Model 3 and Model S, which have the brand’s highest ranges and each can go for just under 375 miles off one charge. Meanwhile, BMW also made a splash at the show by revealing a new electric vehicle that boasts a longer range and faster charging, in further evidence of German automakers’ efforts to fend off growing EV competition. Big European carmakers such as Volkswagen and Renault are already being squeezed by Chinese rivals in cheaper EVs, while Tesla has vowed to turn its factory near Berlin into Europe’s biggest car plant. BMW’s Vision Neue Klasse vehicle, also still in concept stage, uses newly developed battery cells that can store over 20% more energy than those previously used by the company. Overall, charging speed and range are expected to be improved by up to 30% compared with the brand’s previous models, according to the company. “With the Neue Klasse, we have embarked on the biggest investment in the company’s history,” Frank Weber, a BMW board member, said in a statement. The new vehicle is due to roll out in 2025. For Mercedes, the Concept CLA Class is meant to represent “an entirely new all-electric segment of entry-level vehicles at Mercedes-Benz,” appealing to more buyers, according to CEO Ola Källenius. He said the new vehicles “could easily take you from Munich to Hamburg on a single charge.” The longer range may help the legacy automaker lure more customers, as range anxiety is often cited as a major consideration in consumers’ decisions about whether to buy an EV.

This series helps you decide what to do with your shares of the biggest names in tech — Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla — known as the Magnificent Seven. Up next is EV maker Tesla. Tesla (TSLA) has never just been about electric vehicles. Tesla is also about futurism, environmental concerns, its CEO Elon Musk, and faith. \"I’ve called Tesla a faith-based stock, with Elon Musk being at its center,\" Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick told Yahoo Finance. \"And I will say, if you bought Tesla early, the faith has been well rewarded.\" How is Tesla doing as the summer comes to a close? All in all, not great, but not terrible. The stock has more than doubled year to date but faltered in the past month, moving 3.5% lower. Both optimism and pessimism radiate from experts when they talk about the future of one of the most-discussed companies in the world. \"Musk has allowed himself to be pulled in different directions, and it\\'s affected Tesla,\" Sosnick told Yahoo Finance. \"There’s an element of futurism that has always been priced into Tesla. For much of its existence, it rewarded that type of futurism. The question now is ... should we be more concerned about Tesla’s present and near-term, rather than its long-term future?\" Near-term, there is increasing competition coming down the pike.

              "  'By Qiaoyi Li and Brenda Goh BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. automaker Tesla sold 84,159 China-made electric vehicles (EVs) in August, a 9.3% rise from a year earlier, data from the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) showed on Monday. Sales of China-made Model 3 and Model Y cars rose 30.9% from a month earlier. Chinese rival BYD, with its Dynasty and Ocean series of EVs and petrol-electric hybrid models, recorded deliveries of 274,086 passenger vehicles in August, a jump of 57.5% on the year. Tesla started a price war in the world\\'s largest auto market at the start of 2023 to defend its market share, which has come under pressure from chief local rival BYD and smaller players. Its moves included slashing prices in China twice in three days in August and announcing additional cuts on Friday, adding to its July cash rebates and stoking a price war that has drawn in 40-plus brands in China. With sales being prioritised, Tesla\\'s profit margin has taken a hit. Its gross margin from automotive sales plunged to 17.9% in the first half from 27.8% in the year-earlier period, Reuters\\' calculations showed. By contrast, BYD\\'s latest financial disclosure showed its automotive gross margin rose to 20.67% in the six months ended June, an increase of 4.36 percentage points from the year before. Citi analysts said this was helped by the automaker\\'s \"scale production advantages\". On Friday, however, Tesla released a refreshed version of its Model 3 vehicle first in China, with a starting price 12% higher than the previous, base rear-wheel drive model. Other makers including smaller rival Xpeng and newcomer Xiaomi, are looking to announce even more affordable models, intensifying competition. Xpeng will launch an A-class model priced in the 150,000 yuan ($20,571.62) segment under a project called MONA as part of a late August deal to acquire ride-hailing giant Didi\\'s smart EV unit.

Merchants have complained that Amazon unfairly ties access to its marketplace with its logistics service. The long-expected complaint will be the fourth the agency has filed this year targeting Amazon, stepping up pressure by the Biden administration, which has focused on antitrust and competition as a keystone of its economic policy. FTC Chair Lina Khan, Biden’s pick to lead the agency, has long had the online commerce giant in her sights, writing a seminal paper as a law student about how to rethink the antitrust laws in connection with its online platform. Top company executives met with the FTC’s three commissioners in mid-August to discuss the suit, though no settlement was discussed, according to the people.

Amazon said it disagreed with the FTC’s allegations, but agreed to pay $30.8 million to resolve the cases. One month later, the FTC again sued Amazon in a consumer protection case, alleging the company duped consumers into signing up for Prime membership and deliberately made it hard to cancel. Amazon denies the allegations and that suit is ongoing. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier that the new',\n",

Victory Park, a smaller firm, for months has been seeking a buyer for one of those investments, an aggregator named Perch, in a deal that would involve offloading about $400 million in debt, according to the people familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity to discuss private negotiations. Perch, founded by former Wayfair Inc. operations executive Chris Bell, is the second-largest US aggregator and raised almost $1 billion from Victory Park, SoftBank Group Corp. and other investors. Apollo, keen to avoid its exposure to a writedown on Perch that potentially may be in the hundreds of millions of dollars, is getting more involved in trying to sell the company since Victory Park has been unsuccessful, the people said. In recent days, Victory Park appointed new board members to other Amazon aggregators they’ve backed, which the aggregators say amounts to pressure to make them buy a struggling company they don’t want. Representatives of Apollo and Victory Park declined to comment. Read More: Amazon ‘Aggregators’ Who Raised $16 Billion Are Teetering Bloomberg News reported in May that a reckoning had arrived for the nascent aggregator industry, thanks to rising interest rates, higher costs and cooling online demand.

              "  'August is over, and Amazon is (AMZN) ringing in Labor Day weekend with some good news. The e-commerce company closed out six straight months in the green. That marks Amazon\\'s longest consecutive streak of monthly gains since July 2011. The stock closed at $138 on Thursday, representing a 3.2% gain for the month of August. The tech giant has gained roughly $423.7 billion in market cap since the beginning of its winning streak. Thursday\\'s final push came in the aftermath of the company\\'s just-announced Shopify (SHOP) partnership. Amazon announced that its Buy With Prime app will now have an integration with Shopify, making it easier for sellers to connect the Amazon-run payments feature to their Shopify stores. It\\'s more fuel to the fire of Amazon\\'s investment in Buy With Prime, which is seeing some nice adoption among merchants but is still in its early days. \"Amazon announced in January that it had observed 25% higher conversions on merchant sites in its internal data based on the initial buy with Prime program which began in April of \\'22,\" RBC\\'s Brad Erickson wrote on Aug. 31. \"Amazon still only has ~60% of its [third-party] sellers using Prime so this is just another way to drive adoption higher over time.\" \"We do think there has been solid adoption of the existing Buy with Prime program since its full rollout in January,\" Erickson added, \"and there\\'s likely significant crossover between Shopify\\'s [about] 1.75 million merchants and the estimated 2.5 million merchants that sell on Amazon\\'s marketplace — however, still a small tailwind to volume.\" The partnership is just another feather in Amazon\\'s cap. In August, the company reported a series of key earnings beats on operating income, operating margins, and guidance, with the wins temporarily washing away concerns about slowing cloud growth. \"We see 2Q as an inflection quarter for both retail margin and AWS stories and move the name to our favorite idea in Internet,\" UBS analyst Lloyd Walmsley wrote on Aug. 9.

              "  'Amazon (AMZN) ads could take over your life. Already worth billions, Amazon\\'s nascent advertising operation will likely become its next great business. And for the most part, it\\'s flying under investors\\' radars. With its current trajectory, the ad business could even stand toe-to-toe with Amazon\\'s cloud business, Insider Intelligence analyst Andrew Lipsman told Yahoo Finance. \"There\\'s no doubt this advertising business is an unbelievable profit generator,\" Lipsman said. \"The margins are exceptional and could be every bit as important as AWS.\" Investors would be forgiven for missing Amazon\\'s $10.6 billion in advertising revenue in the second quarter. The company didn\\'t start breaking out its ads business in its filings until Q4 2021 when it revealed that the previously unseen division made $31 billion annually. As of Amazon\\'s latest earnings report, the ad business has grown 22% year over year, according to filings. Data is at the center of all this, said Swiftly chief revenue officer Andy Friedland, previously an Amazon ads executive. For e-commerce, better data leads to sales for Amazon and other advertisers. \"Hands down, data is the North Star and the core strength of Amazon’s ad business,\" Friedland told Yahoo Finance. \"They took the time to invest in robust closed-loop-reporting technology and that pays in spades.\" In the next few years, Amazon\\'s ads business may even headline (or sub-headline) the company\\'s earnings reports, as Amazon is uniquely positioned to solve a longstanding problem in e-commerce: getting consumers to move from browsing to buying. Right now, Amazon\\'s ad business is centered on what\\'s called retail media, which is advertising at or near the point of purchase. \"I think advertising [for Amazon] is going to be massive,\" said Brian Mandelbaum, CEO and co-founder of commerce data company Attain. \"It’s part of a marketplace, where advertising is the targeting. Marketers don’t care about clicks anymore. … Amazon has planted a flag in the ground and said, \\'Clicks are dead — it’s all about sales.\\'\" Amazon is a master of both expansion and integration, \"self-reinforcing businesses\" as journalist and author Brad Stone has called them.

              "  'Services activity in world\\'s second-largest economy fell to lowest level in eight months in August Amazon is facing lawsuits from some landlords over its proposed Amazon Fresh grocery stores. One of the latest lawsuits concerns a Long Island lease that Amazon reportedly tried to get out of. Amazon canceled or paused some Fresh stores over the last year as it rethinks its grocery strategy. Amazon is reportedly getting into legal battles with landlords over properties where it was supposed to open Amazon Fresh grocery stores. The latest example is on Long Island, just outside of New York City. There, Amazon is set to face off in court with Salisbury Partners, the New York Post reported on Saturday. In April 2022, Amazon signed a lease with Salisbury for a storefront in East Meadow. The company repeatedly met with Amazon \"to make them happy for months on end, and then in November 2022 they were nitpicking about things like the colors and a light,\" Mark Sagliocca, whose family manages Salisbury and the property in question, told the Post. \"The more I think about it, it was a stall tactic,\" Sagliocca added. Salisbury and Amazon are scheduled to appear in New York state supreme court in Nassau County on Sept. 22, the Post reported. The developer sued Amazon this past spring for $37 million, including unpaid rent on the property. Amazon claims that it has no obligation to pay any rent for the proposed store, according to the Post. \"Like any retailer, we periodically assess our portfolio of stores and make optimization decisions that can lead to closing existing locations or choosing not to pursue building a planned location,\" Jessica Martin, an Amazon spokesperson, told Insider. Salisbury did not respond to a request for comment. In New Jersey, another landlord is suing Amazon for $10 million after it invested in readying one of its properties for an Amazon Fresh store, the Post reported. Amazon has also faced lawsuits from landlords in Philadelphia\\xa0and Seattle, according to the Post. Amazon opened its first Fresh store in 2020 and has about 44 stores three years later,',\n",
              "  'LONDON (Reuters) - Vodafone plans to work with Amazon\\'s low Earth orbit satellite constellation Project Kuiper to extend the reach of its 4G and 5G telecoms networks in Europe and Africa. The British mobile operator said Project Kuiper\\'s high-bandwidth, low-latency satellites would be used to connect mobile base stations in remote locations to its core networks, eliminating the need for fibre-based or fixed wireless links. Amazon is preparing to test two prototype satellites in the coming months before starting to deploy production satellites in 2024 for its network, which will compete with Elon Musk\\'s Starlink, OneWeb and others. Vodafone and Amazon said they would work to roll out Project Kuiper\\'s high-speed broadband services to under-served communities around the world, and also offer services to businesses, such as back-up connections. Dave Limp, Amazon\\'s senior vice president for devices and services, said the partnership would help both customers of both companies \"get the most value from expanded connectivity, particularly in areas like residential broadband, agriculture, education, healthcare, transportation and financial services\". Vodafone CEO Margherita Della Valle said the tie-up would complement the British company\\'s existing work with AST SpaceMobile to develop a space-based mobile network that would connect directly with standard mobile phones without the need for specialised equipment. Telefonica said last month it had teamed up with Starlink to provide internet connections to rural and remote customers. (Reporting by Paul Sandle; Editing by Alexander Smith) Related Quotes',\n",
              "  'Crude oil surges to close at nearly US$87 a barrel, the highest since November 2022 By Anthony Boadle BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Tuesday officially recognized two Indigenous territories, granting them legal protection as reservations to defend against invasions by illegal loggers, gold miners and cattle ranchers. The announcement came on the day Brazil celebrates its Amazon region, home to the world\\'s largest tropical rainforest, the preservation of which is seen as essential to soaking up carbon emissions responsible for global warming. Environmentalists say Indigenous groups are the best guardians of the rainforest and deforestation data shows that the forests on their reservations are the best conserved. Lula, who pledged to legalize the greatest number of reservations possible, has so far signed decrees recognizing eight Indigenous territories since taking office in January. It is a race against time as Brazil\\'s Congress is pushing through legislation that would restrict the recognition of Indigenous land claims, a move backed by the country\\'s powerful farm lobby. The Supreme Court, however, is expected rule that the cut-off date for claiming ancestral lands that were not lived on in 1988 is unconstitutional for denying recognized Indigenous rights. The reservations legalized by Lula on Tuesday are the Acapuri de Cima and the Rio Gregorio Indigenous territories in the states of Amazonas and Acre, respectively. Some 500 Kokama people live on 19,000 hectares (47,000 acres) of rainforest in the first reservation, and 2,000 Katukina and Yawanawá people live on 187,944 hectares (46,420 acres) in the second. Lula plans to recognize six more reservations by the end of the year, said Indigenous Peoples Minister Sonia Guajajara. She said the government\\'s plans to legalize more reservations has led to threats of violence against Indigenous communities based on unfounded rumors. \"They are saying that the demarcations will take land away from farmers, and even villages and towns, which is causing terror,\" she told the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper.

Brown, a vice president with Amazon Web Services, oversees the company’s Elastic Compute Cloud, or EC2. That set of services, essentially computing power for rent, is a core engineering group in AWS, the largest cloud-computing provider. He joined Amazon in 2007, among the first employees of an AWS development outpost in South Africa. Evans has been CEO of self-driving car company Zoox since 2019. Amazon purchased it in 2020. She previously spent more than a decade at Intel Corp. Sivasubramanian, another AWS vice president, oversees data and machine-learning teams, including those piloting the cloud unit’s work in artificial intelligence. He joined Amazon in 2005, according to his LinkedIn profile. “Each are very strong leaders, play critical roles at the Company and exemplify so many of our leadership principles in how they lead every day,” Jassy said. Jassy added four leaders to the S-team in December.
